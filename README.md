# oco-builder

Bootstrap Docker images for building binary packages for [repo.osowoso.org](https://repo.osowoso.org/)

Templates live at [OCO](https://github.com/oSoWoSo/oco) (mirrored to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/oSoWoSo/oco)); binaries are built via CI on GitHub using these images.

## Images

Published to GHCR, updated daily at 03:00 UTC.

| Image | Architecture | libc |
|-------|-------------|------|
| `ghcr.io/osowoso/oco-builder-x86_64` | x86\_64 | glibc |
| `ghcr.io/osowoso/oco-builder-x86_64-musl` | x86\_64 | musl |
| `ghcr.io/osowoso/oco-builder-aarch64` | aarch64 | glibc |
| `ghcr.io/osowoso/oco-builder-aarch64-musl` | aarch64 | musl |

## Usage

```sh
docker run --privileged --rm ghcr.io/osowoso/oco-builder-x86_64 \
  ./xbps-src pkg <template>
```

## How it works

Each image starts from the official `ghcr.io/void-linux/void-*-full` base — pinned by digest in `.github/workflows/build.yml` — runs `xbps-src binary-bootstrap` with `--privileged` (required for chroot mount capabilities), then is smoke tested and committed as a ready-to-use build environment. Every image also carries a `base-<digest>` tag naming the Void release it was built from.

## Bundled tools

In addition to the void base + `xbps-src`, the images include:

- `sudo`, `bash`, `curl`, `git` -- core build needs
- `nodejs` -- for surfer-cli
- `python3` -- runtime for repodata helpers in `oSoWoSo/oco`
- `surfer-cli` -- for managing repository
- `zstd` -- CLI for round-tripping zstd-compressed repodata

The `aarch64-musl` image additionally preloads a small `fcntl64` ABI bridge
for GitHub Actions' glibc-linked ARM Node runtime; other images are unchanged.

## CI secrets

`.github/workflows/feeds.yml` reads these. Only `BOT` is required; the rest
are optional and an unset token means "fetch anonymously", which is what
happened before they existed.

| Secret | Used for |
|--------|----------|
| `BOT` | `gh` CLI operations against the OCO repo — filing and updating `package-update` issues — and the GitHub entry in `feedsparser.py`'s `HOST_AUTH` |
| `CODEBERG` | Codeberg feeds (`Authorization: token`) |
| `GITLAB` | GitLab feeds (`PRIVATE-TOKEN`) |
